Conclusion

Actually, the keypoint here is i'm needed to review each reading and do it repetitvely in implementing way instead of rewatching or rereading. If we just doing reading and watching course repetitively entire time, it just create an Illusion of learning where it conclude like we actually learning something while we're not. we just hear but we don't know about anything at all about that topic, the solution is implementing or trying it, 

For an Example, you want to learn Japanese, you learn it on day 0, review it and translate word by word in day 2, in day 7 try to reverse it become english to japanese and on day 30. you may try to write both direction to test what you really learn about Japanese through the month.

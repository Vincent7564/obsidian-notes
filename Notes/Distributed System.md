# RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

#### RPC itself is a Conceptual most likely people known as API Request for now. Why its called Remote Procedure Call, In my opinion since it call other services remotely to do something in its local system that required to process several data,

### I think most people currently implement a concept that called Microservices. Because of the core function can call the required services. but when other services down as an example i have 2 services, An Auth Services and An Payment Services, if Auth Services down, i still can make a payment because my Payment Services running on different nodes
